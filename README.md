**Bacterial Image Detection for AMR based on Deep Learning**

ABSTRACT:

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a major global health threat, requiring rapid and accurate detection of resistant bacterial strains. This study explores the use of YOLOv8, a deep learning model, for real-time bacterial image recognition, achieving strong results with a mAP@0.5 of 82.1% and 93.5% for Microcolony detection. Python-based augmentation and Roboflow API enriched the dataset, improving model generalization. The work highlights the potential of AI to transform microbiology by enabling faster, scalable, and more accurate diagnostics in the fight against AMR.
